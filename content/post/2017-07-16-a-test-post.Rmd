Here is a simple example of plotting an interactive map with tmap, which is based of leaflet.

```{r tmap, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

library(tmap)
library(sp)
library(rgdal)
library(rgeos)
library(leaflet)

tmap_mode("view")
pol<-gBuffer(SpatialPoints(matrix(c(-75,45),ncol=2)),width=2)
map<-tm_shape(pol)+tm_polygons()+tm_layout(basemaps=c("Esri.WorldImagery"))

map

```

It is that simple! We could also try to implement a dygraph, which is another javascript graphing system which has been wrapped in an R package called dygraphs. 

```{r dygraph, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

library(dygraphs)
library(xts)

x<-runif(100)
y<-runif(100)
t<-as.Date(1:100)
ts<-xts(cbind(x,y),t)
dy<-dygraph(ts) %>% 
	dyRangeSelector()
dy

```
