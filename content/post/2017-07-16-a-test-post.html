<p>Here is a simple example of plotting an interactive map with tmap, which is based of leaflet.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tmap)

<p>It is that simple! We could also try to implement a dygraph, which is another javascript graphing system which has been wrapped in an R package called dygraphs.</p>
